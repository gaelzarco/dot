Dear Nova1625 Team,

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas applying for the
part-time/internship Web Developer role. I am seeking hands-on experience
contributing to real-world projects while continuing to grow in a professional
development environment.

I have formal work experience as a Web Developer and IT Technician, building and
maintaining web applications using *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*, and *PHP*. My work
has included front-end development, responsive UI improvements, third-party API
integrations, and collaboration through *Git*-based workflows. I am comfortable
shipping features, fixing bugs, and communicating clearly with both technical
teams and clients.

Alongside my professional experience, I actively build personal projects using
tools such as *C++*, *Next.js*, *Rust*, and self-hosted infrastructure. I value
clean code, thoughtful UI/UX, and continuous learning.

I am ecstatic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and grow as a developer
while supporting meaningful projects. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards, \  
*Gael Zarco*
